# Exercises

1. What do you think the Big-O (worst-case) complexity of this algorithm is? 
2. What do you think the best-case complexity of this algorithm is? 
	- Note-- assume you do not have any information about if the array is already sorted or not.
3. Does selection sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? 
	- i.e. Did you have to allocate any extra memory to perform the sort?
5. Would the Big-O complexity change if we used a linked list instead of an array?

## Answers:

1. Time complexity and space complexity. We should save time and space, expecailly time.
2. Maybe it is just a chance but not  our normal way.
3. Yes. We will use a "temp" to locate new thing to finish the "swap".
4. The time is saved.
