# Exercise 1

1. Record here how long it took you to run bubblesort and csort (Note: If you want to run several trials, say '10' and take an average that is an even better result!).

*bubblesort: 0m0.339s*
*csort:      0m0.008s*

# Exercise 2

What is the Big-O complexity of bubblesort?

1. *between O(n) and O(n^2)*

# Exercise 3

Do a little research and discover what algorithm qsort is in the C standard library. What is the algorithm? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qsort

1. *It compare "two" element in the array to sort them. after we us the "loop" it works well for all the elements. and It's fast despite it is O(n). *
2. -3 q3 - qsort uses a quick sort variant; -2 q4 - quick sort is average case O(nlogn); -5 q8 - no answer

# Exercise 4

What is the Big-O complexity of 'qsort' that we use in the csort program?

1. *O(n)*
2. -3 q3 - qsort uses a quick sort variant; -2 q4 - quick sort is average case O(nlogn); -5 q8 - no answer

# Exercise 5

Is qsort's Big-O complexity better or worse than bubblesort? (Anser: Yes it is better/ No it is worse/ It is equal)

1. *Yes it is better*

# Exercise 6

List the following functions in terms of their Big-O complexity from **smallest** to **largest**.

1. *LogN， N， N!, N^2, N^3, 2^n*

# Exercise 7

- Given: f(n) = 3n^3 + n^2 + 27
- What is the O(n) of f(n)?

1. *N^3*

# Exercise 8

- Given: f(n) = 3n^3 + n^2 + 27
- -3 q3 - qsort uses a quick sort variant; -2 q4 - quick sort is average case O(nlogn); -5 q8 - no answer
